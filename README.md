<h3>all_records_pull.py</h3>

The **all_records_pull.py** script is responsible for making API calls using predefined queries, processing the data, and handling logging functionalities. This script works in conjunction with other modules such as gen_config, utils, work_rqsts, scratch2 and queries to automate the process of retrieving data from an API and handling log file management.

<h3>How It Works</h3>

- **API Authentication**:
    The script authenticates using OAuth2 credentials (client ID, client secret, username, password), which are loaded from environment variables.
- **Query Processing**:
    It processes multiple queries (defined in the queries module) by sending requests to the API and handling the response data.
- **Logging**:
    Logging is configured for debugging and tracking script execution.
- **Log File Management**:
    The script compresses old log files located in a specified directory to manage disk space.

<h3>classes.py</h3>

The AccessTokenHandler class in **classes.py** is designed to manage API authentication tokens. It handles retrieving cached tokens, saving new tokens, checking token validity, and refreshing tokens when necessary.

**Attributes**

- **cache_file**: The file used to store the cached token (default is token_cache.json).
- **client_id**: The client ID for OAuth2 authentication.
- **client_secret**: The client secret for OAuth2 authentication.
- **auth_url**: The URL to request the access token from.
- **username**: The username for OAuth2 authentication (if using password grant type).
- **password**: The password for OAuth2 authentication (if using password grant type).

**Methods**

- **__init__**:
    Initializes the AccessTokenHandler class with API credentials and cache file location.
- **load_token()**:
    Attempts to load the cached token from the specified cache file. Returns the token data if available and valid; otherwise, returns None.
- **save_token(token_response)**:
    Saves the token response to the cache file. It calculates the expiration time by adding the expires_in value (in seconds) to the current time.
- **is_token_valid(token_response)**:
    Checks if the token is still valid by comparing the current time to the tokenâ€™s expiration timestamp (expires_at field). Returns True if the token is valid, False otherwise.
- **get_cached_token()**:
    Retrieves the access token from the cache if it exists and is still valid. Returns the token string or None if no valid token is found.
- **refresh_token()**:
    Makes an API request to refresh the access token if the cached token is invalid or expired. It requires the auth_url, client_id, client_secret, username, and password to be set.
    On success, the new token is saved to the cache, and the token is returned. On failure, it prints an error message and returns None.

<h3>gen_config.py</h3>

The **gen_config.py** file is responsible for configuring a logging system for Python scripts. It sets up a logger that writes log messages both to a dynamically named log file and the console. This logging utility helps with tracking the execution and debugging of scripts in a structured and easily accessible format.

-----
**Function: configure_logger(script_name)**

The configure_logger function creates and returns a logger instance that logs messages to both a log file and the console.

**Parameters:**

- **script_name**: A string representing the name of the script or the logger instance. This name is used to identify the log messages and is part of the log file name.

**How It Works:**

- **Log Directory Creation**:
    The function checks if the log directory (Documents/Dossier7_Files/Logs) exists on the user's system. If it does not exist, it creates the directory using the utils.create_directory_if_not_exists_log() utility function.
- **Log File Name**:
    A log file is created with a dynamic timestamp (in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS) to ensure unique log file names.
- **Logger Configuration**:
    A logger instance is initialized with the script_name.
    The logger is configured to log messages at the DEBUG level (the most detailed logging level).
- **Handlers**:
    The logger has two handlers:
       **File Handler**: Logs all messages to a .txt file inside the Logs directory.
       **Stream Handler**: Outputs log messages to the console (standard output).
- **Log Format**:
    Each log message is formatted with a timestamp, the logger's name (script_name), the log level, and the message.
- **Returns:**
   The configured logger instance, which can be used to log messages from the script.

<h3>queries.py</h3>

The **queries.py** file defines a set of pre-configured queries used for making API requests to various endpoints of a system such as assets, part_usage, parts_in_storerooms, personnel, sites, tasks, preventive_mx_comp, purchase_orders, time_segments, top_level_parts, work_ord and many others. Each query is represented as a dictionary that contains information like the API endpoint, filters, ordering, and expanded fields to be included in the API call.

This file is structured to allow seamless integration with API handling logic in the codebase. The queries defined here are intended to pull specific sets of data from the system's API.

-----
**Structure**

The file contains a Python list called queries, where each item in the list is a dictionary representing an API query. Each dictionary includes the following components:

-**Fields in Each Query:**

- **name**: A string representing the name of the query. This is used to identify what data the query is fetching (e.g., "assets", "part_usage").
- **result_type**: Specifies the type of data returned. It could be entity (representing individual objects) or transactional (representing transactional records).
- **payload**: This dictionary contains the parameters that control how the query is executed, including:
   - **page**: The page number of the results (used for pagination).
   - **amount**: The number of records to return per page.
   - **groupBy**: An empty list (if no grouping is applied).
   - **filter**: A set of filters applied to the query to retrieve only relevant records.
   - **orderBy**: Specifies the sorting order of the results.
   - **expands**: Specifies which related fields to expand (nested objects).
- **baseUrl**: The API endpoint to which the query is sent.
